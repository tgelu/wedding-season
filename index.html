                <p>Hello, My name is Alexandra Timoficiuc, and I started this small company after I discovered how much I enjoyed planning my own wedding in 2015. For all who might care, besides weddings, I love my black cat and my husband, with whom I live in a small house in cold, gloomy Denmark.</p>
                <p>Without further ado, here I am, the person behind Wedding Season, with quirks, dreams and funny faces.</p>

                <p>Given the personal nature of the relationship between the wedding planner and the couple, I consider it crucial to lay down my commitments and promises to whomever I work with. This makes me an accountable friend and sets a healthy foundation for my professional interactions.</p>
                <p>Marriage is full of meaning, and just as it is based on a promise so must be its celebration.</p>

                <p>I think wedding planning is wrongly pervieced as a high-end service. I honestly believe you shouldn't have to make a decision between the perfect dress and a wedding planner.</p>
