Today, on this beautiful spring day I am taking time to discuss how to choose the wedding venue. Choosing the venue is considered (by the majority of wedding professionals and brides) the most time consuming and stressful part of wedding planning. 
But really, there should be no surprise, since I believe that the venue is actually setting the tone for your wedding celebrations.
Of course, you can shape it regardless of its unique style or architecture, but keep in mind: there is only so much one can do with something so set in stone. Also due to lack of thorough consideration, a clash could be created by the style you chose and the existing one at your venue, but we will get into that later. 
The process is as follows: first, you pick the groom and then the venue. Well, that is a slight exaggeration, but you get the idea: it is vital to book your site before anything else, and anyway there is so little you can do in terms of planning before you book your venue.
I think that every good thing starts with a budget, so:
Advice number one: sit down and look at the numbers. Decide right from the beginning where you want to splurge and save up. Most of the couples have the cosy set up in mind, so their more substantial investments are on these three: venue, food, music.
Others, with a more adventurous heart, splurge on travelling with their nearest and dearest for the wedding. Still, some choose their parents' farm, so they save up for a home after their nuptials.
But regardless of the mindset, you may find yourself in; you need a venue, a place to gather to celebrate.
After the budget, a few things will come up, quite essential matters because they are closely connected to your venue deliberations. 
One is the wedding date. 
If you are keen on a specific date, something meaningful to you as a couple then the search for your venue will get a little bit more complicated since many of the traditional sites: castles, manor houses, hotels are booked in advance.
