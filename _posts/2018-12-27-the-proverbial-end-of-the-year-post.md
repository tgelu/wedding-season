I have a little thing I love doing once in a while and especially during this
hectic time at the end of the year. I schedule a year's review. Literally, I sit
down on my comfy couch, and I put on display all the photos we took that year,
in a random order, all the pretty ones, the staged, curated ones and all the
goofy, silly ones. So the year is played in front of my eyes, and it reminds me
of how wonderful it was. Every year was wonderful, but I think this one was
quite special.

But to be honest, my favorite so far was 2015, the year when we got engaged and
married at a distance of 4 short months. That year holds the vastest array of
emotions. Being a fiancee and then a newly married lady were the best statuses
in my life.

But this year my professional life took the stage, and I must admit it was
thrilling and filled with emotions at every corner, sometimes the good kind and
sometimes the one that makes you sob and cry, nevertheless wonderful.

This year started with me being a boss-lady, a thing I always dreamed of but
still paralyzed me with fear. But that's okay, I have heard that if your dreams
don't scare you, they aren't big enough. Oh, and how this one still scares me...
I had ups and downs and also a change of heart in regards to the path I will be
walking on from now on. I am still on the point of addressing my course, so we
work hard on the website to better communicate my passion and vision within the
wedding industry, and I am focusing a lot of time and energy on learning new
skills in order to better serve the wedding industry.

It has been a fun ride, as my photo slide is showing me and I am so blessed with
people that supported me and invested in me throughout this year, my hubs
especially. He is behind every little tech detail of Wedding Season, behind
every decision I made, and every discouraged Monday morning that he transformed
in a motivational speech routine. He made me coffee, prayed with me and taught
me so much of what I know now tech and business wise. He is my very loved pebble
on which Wedding Season stands.

Also, many other people were beside me, with words of encouragement and a nudge
to move further at times. During this holiday season, I can't help but be
grateful for all the many footsteps I have seen alongside mine this past year.

Next time I will come and tell you about my adventures of last month when I
planned my first wedding styled-shoot, about how much I enjoyed it and ... ehm
how many mistakes I made and learned from.
