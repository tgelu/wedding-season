I hope your week has been as great as mine, which consisted mostly of stirring my creative bones by working on my garden project. I am growing my own plants for a style shoot I am planning for later this summer and learning calligraphy. Both endeavors I enjoy doing but the highlight of my week was working on this beautiful real wedding I am sharing with you today.

Steffie and Ben got married on the 1st of September 2017 in Deidesheim, Germany surrounded by the closest and dearest. It was a bridal party of 25 guests, the perfect number for the intimate wedding they had in mind.

I love all the personal details of this wedding day including the laid-back style of their nuptials, like the bride getting ready in their cozy apartment. For this, truth be told, I feel a little envy... don't worry, the good kind, where you crave for inspiration. Seriously, have you noticed their huge vintagey mirror and their bathtub? And the priest that plays the guitar for the couple's ceremony, how special is that?!

The bride's "something blue" is the cutest pair of heels that were beautifully complemented by the pearl earrings and the silver hair piece.
The couple chose hues of white with yellow touches for their florals. This gently suggestes the end of summer. But they went for pies and berry-filled wedding cake to celebrate the beginning of autumn.

The [location](http://dashofgut.com) is absolutely gorgeous and such a great choice for their small wedding bash. It provided the rustic touch that underlined their desired feeling for the day: rugged walls, exposed beams, wooden tables and generally a very homey atmosphere.

The couple being snugged by the greenery of the vineyard and the soft light of September the portraits couldn't be anything but dazzling.
 
Thank you, [Candida and Max Jan](https://candidaundmaxjan.de/wedding/) for this beautiful feature.
 
A bit about the day from the photographers:
> A few weeks back we were able to shoot the wonderful wedding of Steffie & Ben as their wedding photographer in Deidesheim.
> These two celebrated their wedding with just their closest family and friends, which made their big day even more intimate and special.
>
> We started the day with them both getting ready. The bride stayed at home in their super stylish and cozy flat, where Candida had the chance to take some wonderful photos of her.
>
> Max Jan joined the boys getting ready at the hotel "Deidesheimer Hof" right in the center of Deidesheim.
> After both being prepared and ready for their day, we went to the small chapel in Gimmeldingen where their very emotional ceremony took place.
> There were laughter and crying, some really intense moments and a huge amount of love. We both were definitely touched a few times that day.
>
> After their ceremony, we drove to their wedding venue, the [“Hofgut Ruppertsberg”](http://dashofgut.com), where their celebration and the party took place. The venue is in between vineyards and small hills and was the perfect location for us as wedding photographers in Deidesheim.
> During the whole day, both the bride and the groom were smiling almost every second letting all guests feel their deep and endless love for each other.
>
> We are thankful we had the chance to be a part of their wonderful wedding
 
I hope you will enjoy this intimate wedding day and get inspired.
Until next time,
