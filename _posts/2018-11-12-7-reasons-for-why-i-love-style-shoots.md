I decided to share with you this love of mine for style-shoots. This post is
closely related to my recent rebranding endeavors and my current, mad daily
schedule. As you know, I decided to take a step back and look at the wedding
industry from a different perspective. Starting this month, therefore, I will
work on being a source of inspiration and building a community. On sharing with
you all the lovely companies (wedding vendors and suppliers)  that I discover,
the ones that tickle my own brain, and that are working hard to serve the brides
and grooms from all the tastes and styles specter, and to publicly applaud their
great results.

Also, I am very excited to announce that at the end of this month I am planning
my very first style-shoot and I hope it will inspire some of you and that it
will be a sweet, hyggelig feast for your eyes.  But until then, here are some of
the reasons I love style-shoots, and I absolutely recommend them to all the
wedding creatives:

## 1. Style-shoots are a great way of showing off
I see them as opportunities to create something truly unique, to let your mind
roam free, having only the sky as the limit.  An opportunity that you don't have
while working for a client since they are usually quite set on what they want
and they have their own budget to consider. So regardless of what **you**
envision for their day, the ultimate decision is theirs. 

## 2. To challenge the market or the industry.
Your peers will appreciate your creativity, and they will be ignited to follow
your example, to come up with a new piece of decor, an out of the box wedding
band, or floral installation. Who knows, maybe your creative team will come up
with the next big wedding trend...  Nonetheless, your spark will break the
dullness, and it will raise the level of innovation, from which we all will
benefit, including the bride and grooms.

## 3. Style-shoots provides us with networking...
...which we absolutely need for our businesses to succeed.
Building a community of like-minded creatives and working together should be our
goal. Every wedding vendor has a certain vibe, a voice, a style. The idea is to
find those that sing a similar tune to yours, and wonderful collaborations will
flow, and the industry will flourish through this small clusters of united
creatives mind. 

## 4. It makes you a better professional in our industry
Training your creativity with every occasion you have will better equip you to
serve any type of client, prepared for every request. It extends your
portfolio. It boosts your confidence, and it makes you bold.

## 5. Style-shoots are a way of trying something new
Nobody is paying you to experience, as far as I know. Maybe for the last five
years, you had to bake baby shower cakes to keep your business going and
growing, but you would like to try your hand at baking a fancy, tiered cake,
modern and edgy and you want to get credit for it. Just put your Yes Hat and
join a team that works on an inspirational shoot and your portfolio will burst
with diversity and innovation. 

## 6. It's fun, exciting and refreshing
I feel that the pressure is lower when you are working with a team you know, and
you were keen on working with, on the concept you helped create. Rather than
when you work with someone else's vision, time and money. The need to perform is
higher, and therefore maybe the excitement is lower?

## 7. SEO
This is what brings the clients at the door. And for good ranking, you need
original content. How do you get that? Organizing or joining style shoots in the
off wedding season is the method the big names in the industry use to keep their
business relevant and updated.  Just check the market this month (which is known
to be an off wedding season month) and read the editorials- most of them are
inspiration shoots on various themes, and I can't help but be inspired and fired
up by what my colleagues came up with.

I am happy for the rejuvenation that comes with the offseason, and I am looking
forward to being part of it with my little style-shoot. I hope it will create a
ripple. 

I can't wait to present you my lovely team and our work once we are done.  So
stay tuned!
