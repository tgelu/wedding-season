Hi peeps!
I am sorry for the long radio silence. Last month was simply packed
with preparations for the wedding styled-shoot I planned in my little countryside
town. And the beginning of December found me laying on my comfy couch sipping my
advent calendar tea, recovering from what was a  very busy season.

I am back now with the sweetest wedding feature which I am sure will brighten
your short winter days, mostly because it is a summer wedding, filled with
gorgeous light and summery wedding details: just look at those stunning
bouquets. But also because Sean and Judy are an amazing couple. They are warm,
kind, and fun-loving which will surely touch your hearts.

The lovely story behind this feature is that while I was in the frenzy of last
month when stress levels were quite high and I was aimlessly scrolling through
my Instagram feed, one photo caught my attention and it stirred my heart.
It was one simple but meaningful shot: a bride praying together with her
bridesmaids on her wedding day, all dressed in white looking natural and serene.
I took a second and said a short prayer myself, then I went looking for the
photographer. I am so happy I found Timo from [Whole Hearted
Weddings](https://www.wholehearted-weddings.com/), I love his work, and I am
pleased to see he is based so close to home (Germany).

I, of course, started to follow him and went dooown on his feed and sent hearts
to all of their lovely photos, as one does when they discover someone with
similar tastes on Instagram. Only to wake up the next day to the most
wonderful notification, which makes me always so so happy. It is titled "üòç Someone
submitted a wedding! üéâ" and guess what? It was from Timo
[@WholeheartedWeddings](https://www.instagram.com/wholeheartedweddings/)
that was submitting exactly the wedding that caught my attention the day before.
Oh, it was such a lovely surprise! Thank you very much, Timo!

Without further ado, I introduce you to Sean and Judy, their story and the
one who made it available for us.

## From the photographer

<blockquote>
"Judy and Sean first met through mutual friends, back in Canada a couple of
years ago. Eventually, Sean moved to Paris and Judy was living back in Germany.
After a couple of months of long distance relationship, Sean moved from Paris to
a tiny town in Germany. For their love he started a new job and learning a new
language and I guess he won Judy's heart. Their wedding day was on the 19th May
2018 with the reception in a beautiful barn only 5 minutes from their apartment
in Horn, Germany ‚Äî a little town with lots of pretty fields and hills. They
decided on a mix of boho and vintage, with beautiful DIY decoration, bouquets
and all done by the bride herself and her friends."

<blockquote>
"One of my favorite moments was when they entered the ceremony. Due to how the
church was built, there wasn‚Äôt really an aisle to walk down to, so instead, they
both walked in through two entrances facing each other and met in the middle.
This was really unique but also a nightmare to photograph. I couldn‚Äôt have done
it without my awesome second shooter - <a href="https://www.joranlooij.com" title="Joran Looij">Joran Looij</a>

<blockquote>
"Another highlight was during the reception. Judy sang one of the many songs she
wrote in the past years, and you could‚Äôve heard a pin drop while she sang. I got
goosebumps all around. But just the overall atmosphere was a winner too. Many
people flew in from Canada, and you could just feel that everyone loved to be
there, you could feel their love for Sean & Judy, and everyone seemed to have a
blast celebrating with them."

<blockquote>
"That‚Äôs actually my favorite part about weddings when you feel that the entire
bridal party is all in, and when the couple's love for each other and the
guests' love for the couple mixes, and brings about one unforgettable
atmosphere.  And of course, I love sparkling exits. I think their faces say it
all."

I am so blessed to feature only down to earth weddings, where the family
atmosphere and intimacy trumps over built-in gimmicks. I am a sucker for
emotional moments, filled with laughter and teary speeches, personal vows,
genuine and quirky love being visible throughout the day. Yes, I appreciate
stunning design, creative decor, epic views or venues but I think that at the
end of the day what matters most is living the best day of your life with the
best people in your life. Sounds very much like any cliche in a very good
rom-com, but precisely those get us to the movies over and over again. We are
all softies at heart and yearn for deep connections and beautiful love stories.
And this is just it - a great plot for the big screens. 

And hey, DIYs take courage and creativity, so great job you people that made
this wedding a lovely bohemian dream. A round of applause for friends and
families involved in planning, logistics, and decorations.
