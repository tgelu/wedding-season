Happy Midsummer, peeps! I have enjoyed the long evenings and the warm light so much, and I am a bit sad that the days' length has started shortening. Fortunately, I do get to still bask in the summer morning light with a coffee in my hand, and a cozy blanket on my shoulders and that has become my favorite moment of the day. The fresh air, the quietness and stillness of all, here and now interrupted by the sound of birds' chirping. It sounds too idyllic maybe? But that's how my days start thanks to this year's glorious Scandinavian summer.

I was thinking that today is the perfect day for a summer wedding season recap, to look at just a few trends that I have seen emerging in the last months. I have an [instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/BkVW2dLnmzb)  exactly about this so you can go there for the summary but below you will get the unfolded version. 

## Clean and modern looks

Simple and minimal decor is the first tendency I have noticed: working with a monochrome vision, or with Scandinavian interior design elements such as elegant neutrals, clean cuts, fine finishings, metal and geometric details. Also, I think it is becoming more popular beautiful combinations of concrete, industrial spaces with wood features. Scandi style is cool as its climate, so go for it.

## Textiles

Textiles became an essential element for wedding decor thanks to the Moroccan infused style in interior design and event planning. I suggest you start piling up mixed tea towels, in vibrant colors and patterns, bed throws, pillows, blankets, leather ottomans, and any other Moroccan accessories to create spaces and facilitate closeness and guest grouping.

## Yellow

Yellow and its enchanting hues are on the rise. More and more often it is used for florals, wedding accessories, wedding attires and even tableware, such as ochre plates, or marigold press glass goblets. These are, by the way, so popular now. Maybe because of the immediate boho vibe they bring. Maybe yellow will be next yearâ€™s [official color](https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year-2018)?

## Smoke bombs

These have been around for a few years, but they reached their peak this summer, it seems. I saw it at a friend wedding back in 2015, but I was reluctant in believing that they will become so hip... now here we are. I can't say I am a fan, or that I would opt for it (I guess I am not as cool and alternative as I thought I am) but I admit: all the shots I have seen with smoke bombs are quite awesome!

## Depth and height in floral arrangements

Playing with depth and height in the floral details such as the bouquets, tablescapes or any floral installations is quite a thing these days. Hanging installation, flower walls and backgrounds are high on the list of requests.
Also, a whole bunch of unpopular blossoms are used in such creative ways this season. Maybe we will finally say goodbye to stuffy bouquets with imitation pearl pins and welcome to the wild, free, and natural bouquets.

## Epic or dramatic scenery

The preference for epic and dramatic scenery is growing. There are a whole plethora of talented and creative photographers with no cookie cutter ideas. They are ready to travel with the most courageous and alternative brides ready to climb and to get their dresses a bit muddy for the moodiest and out of this world couple shots.

## Pets

Oh the love of pets is reaching a new level, and I am totally on this furry bandwagon! I am happy that finally, the wedding industry opened its gates and arms to welcome the pooch. Weddings are for your closest and dearest, and that should include your four-legged friend. And they totally change the dynamic of the festivities and your smile on the couples portraits. And all for the best.
