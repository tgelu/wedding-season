Today I am so delighted to have one of [Hannah’s](https://hannahkphotography.co.uk/) weddings to feature. Not only because I love her sweet, romantic style of photography but because Laura and Clive’s day is the perfect embodiment of autumn! Also, it represents what I love most about weddings: intimate celebrations where the family is hands-on from the beginning until the end. Where coming together as one family is the center of the day.

So thank you, Hannah, for sharing this beautiful day with us, and I hope you guys will love and get inspired by Clive and Laura’s beautiful day as much as I did. And I would guess it’s impossible not to be since the keywords are: Autumn, English country theme, and DIY.

## Words from the photographer

Clive and Laura became husband and wife on a wonderful autumn day, much like today, in September 2017, in an idyllic English village called Westmill, about 25 miles south of Cambridge.
They chose to say their <em>I Do’s</em> in the village’s local chapel surrounded by 100 of their closest friends and family members. And what better way to celebrate afterward than in a tipi with <em>"help yourself kegs"</em> a country/swing band and cozy blankets to keep warm!

The day started with Laura and her bridesmaids getting ready at her mum’s cottage that was so welcoming and picturesque, the perfect atmosphere that set up the stage for this lovely autumn wedding! After the ceremony, I took the bride and groom walking through the town’s streets where we stopped at a few iconic locations such as the tea room and old water well and took pictures.

The short walk to the tipi was lined with bunting and bulb lights that were carefully and lovingly strung by friends and family, and it seemed that the entire village had participated in making this day truly special for Laura and Clive.

## Words from the Bride

### Theme or color scheme
Autumn English country wedding 

### Decoration
Lots of white bunting! The mother of the bride hand-made approx. 2km of white bunting which lined the street from the church to the wedding reception. Outside the tipi we had festoon lighting on shepherd’s crooks along with antique milk churns for large flowers. Inside the tipi, there were fairy lights, old-fashioned playing cards with letters on to spell
out our names, mini white bunting, polaroid pics, more natural flowers, and teacups and saucers for wedding favors and lots more.

### The Food
Entrée:
1. Lapsang smoked duck with blackberry jellies, goat’s cheese, and pomegranate & walnut salad
2. Roasted asparagus, artichokes, beetroot, with dolcelatte mouse and walnuts
Main:
1. Cannon of English lamb with moussaka-stuffed aubergine, cherry vine tomatoes, and lemon olive and tomato drizzle.
2. Seabass with a coconut, chili and lemongrass sauce with wilted bok choi and sweet potato.
Cake:
We didn’t go for a traditional wedding cake and instead went for a cheesecake (actual
cheese) which formed part of our cheese and port course served after dinner.

### What were some of the DIY projects
We made and hand-painted the signs (for the church, car park, etc.), all the teacups came with tags which were handwritten in calligraphy by the mother-of-the-bride. Table names (which were named after relatives no longer with us) were made
with watercolors by the bride. Miniature cheesecake decorations were also made by the bride and the cheese labels written by one of the bridesmaids, and lots more including all the invites!

### What was the best part of the day?
*Laura*: Saying our vows, seeing husband-to-be waiting at the altar and grooms speech
about the bride.

*Clive*: The moment I turned around and saw my best friend walking up the aisle to marry me.
