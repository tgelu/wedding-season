Hi, peeps, I hope you are enjoying this amazing season, I most certainly do, it
has been actually an Indian summer kind of autumn here up north, and I couldn't
be happier. I go for long walks and for coffee out on the porch to revel in a
soft chill and lovely sunshine. I baked some cakes, and I admired my little
flower garden's effort in coloring the neighborhood. Did I tell you that my
darling town feels most times like *Stars Hollow*? Well, this season while
walking my narrow little streets I kind of expected to meet Lorelai and buy her
coffee (Yess, I am a huuge [Gilmore Girls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilmore_Girls) fan)

So I hope that no matter where you are at, this season is treating you well;
otherwise, I have just the sweetest treat for you in the form of this lovely
wedding feature from [Hannah](https://hannahkphotography.co.uk/). It's a family
affair through and through, and sweet and romantic as anything can be.  As per
usual, take your cuppa and enjoy browsing and being inspired by this warm and
heartfelt wedding day. 

## From the photographer:

<blockquote>
"In the morning I arrived at the bride’s parent’s house where I was
welcomed by a huge hug from Nay, the glorious smell of cinnamon buns, Norah
Jones playing in the background and warm laughter from all the girls getting
ready together. It felt like Christmas day!! When I walked upstairs, I couldn’t
believe that Nay had laid out all the bridesmaid dresses with individual photos
of her with each bridesmaid and personalized gifts for each of them. Nay even
went as far as re-painting her bedroom to match her wedding colors! It really
gave a minimal, clean backdrop for the photographs which I couldn’t have
appreciated more!

Nay and Dan both have a firm belief and love for God, so it was no question they
would have their ceremony at St Mary de Lode Church where Nay’s father could
marry them. It was truly a family affair with Dan’s sisters reading scripture,
Nay’s sister leading everyone in sung worship, her mother and father giving her
away, her father marrying them and Dan’s father bringing the message. Clearly
family is very important to this bride and groom, and that was beautifully
reflected in these special roles.

Following the ceremony, Nay and Dan drove off in a vintage VW camper van to
their reception venue, Brockworth Court Tithe Barn. As the sun set, guests
enjoyed drinks in the courtyard and wrapped up warm inside the barn for dinner
and speeches. I LOVE barn wedding venues because they give a natural and down to
earth feel to the day. Brockworth Court ranks even higher in my book with its
outdoor firepits and plenty of dance floor space which Function Fever kept
chock-full until the very end! (Shout out to my husband, Joel for killing it on
the drums!!) Nay being a dance teacher had choreographed her and Dan’s first
dance… it was amazing, and the eruption of applause from guests at the end
clearly proved that! And then, what better way to exit your wedding than in a
WHEELBARROW decorated so lovingly by your wedding party. ;) What an end to an
incredible wedding season."

## From Nay, the Bride:

### The inspiration for the chosen theme or decor
<blockquote>
"I have to say that I fell in love with the barn first and then the rustic-y
chic theme came out of that. We've always been a fan of the natural, slightly
rugged look, so that helped too. I had a big board on Pinterest for the wedding
which was a great inspiration, but with each bit, we added our own style to make
it more unique."
</blockquote>

### DIY projects
<blockquote>
"Practically the entire wedding, from the table decorations to the dress! I had
so many talented bridesmaids to help me out. My maid of honor did all the
calligraphy for the invites, chalkboards and the Order of Service's. A family
friend of mine altered my dress and also changed the neckline of it to suit me
better. One bridesmaid did all the flowers, and another bridesmaid created a
kids area with activities and games. I made bunting, collected and decorated
jars, and we had a setup day on the day before with the bridal party and all the
family chipping in to help decorate. So fun!"

### Favourite moments of the day
<blockquote>
"Am I allowed to say the whole day? So hard to choose! Probably the moment when
we said 'I do' (we actually said 'I will'). I was so emotional that I had to
pause the vows before continuing but the moment we were declared 'husband and
wife' was just a feeling of pure joy and excitement. Knowing I'd made some
pretty hefty vows to my best friend was an incredible feeling."

### What did and what didn't go as planned
<blockquote>
"To be honest, it all ran pretty smoothly thanks to the Best Man. Admittedly, I
stepped on my dress and couldn't recover myself so ended in a white heap on the
floor. Fortunately, I was just with my husband and bridesmaids at the time, so
not many saw that!  The one moment that didn't go to plan was the departure. We
ended up leaving half an hour early because people kept having to leave for work
the next day and we didn't want to leave when everyone else had gone. So we
wheelbarrow-ed out at 10 pm!"
