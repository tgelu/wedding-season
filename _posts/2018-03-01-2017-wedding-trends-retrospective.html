    I love where the bridal industry is heading. For a few years now the keywords are crafted according to my personal mood board, and I couldn’t be more ecstatic.
    I would go on and dare say that the all-encompassing word defining the industry now, the arch if you will, is non-conventional, followed by authenticity, personal, whimsy, boho. 
</p>
<p>
    I developed an interest for the bridal industry when Rustic was the style and barn celebrations weren’t a necessity anymore but a chic trend. Ever since (only a few years)
    I have diligently followed the industry’s tendencies, and I happen to think that an overview is due, now that the 2018 wedding season is ready to blossom. 
</p>
<p>
    To be honest, I think <a href="https://www.vogue.com.au/brides/trends/these-are-the-11-biggest-bridal-trends-in-2017-according-to-pinterest/image-gallery/2b89a2346d1b45c0b3b0868b14beeea6" title="These are the 11 biggest bridal trends in 2017, according to Pinterest" target="_blank" rel="external">2017’s wedding trends</a>
    are my all time favourite because they are the pinnacle of beautifully unique. 2017 is where the alternative everything has come unto the stage like floral
    embroidery for the white dress, sweets table instead of the 10 tier cake or other quirky fashions.

    I noticed a change in the styles, the themes the couples went for diversified a little bit: we got proper vintage weddings,
    not only the Great Gatsby vintage decor, but the 50’ and 60’ got an authentic representation. I enjoyed the shabby chic theme
    that included a lot of home decor elements, like cupboards or the mixed and matched tea cups.

    Of course, the outdoor weddings, enchanted our eyes with dramatic decor, like the Black Sand Beach or the Yosemite Park. And I think
    that <a href="https://www.pinterest.dk/weddingseason_events/bohemian-woodland/" title="Bohemian Woodland pictures collection" target="_blank" rel="external">bohemian woodland</a>
    became my favourite wedding theme during last year due to all the styled shoots and my obsession with greenery.

    2017 brought the incredibly awesome food DIY stations and the canape and cocktail hour popularity. It put the focus on locally supplied catering,
    and gourmet dining, the signature cocktails, the oh so beautiful and delicious doughnut wall, and the gorgeous drip cake (replacing the famous naked cake),
    to name just a few and only within the meal and merriment department.

    It also made autumn quite the trendy season for tying the knot, so Pinterest was pouring with Autumn Wedding inspiration boards.
    That’s when I also created <a href="https://www.pinterest.dk/weddingseason_events/fall-wedding/" title="Fall Wedding inspiration collection" target="_blank" rel="external">mine</a>,
    even though I had a hunch a while back (2015, when I chose Fall for my wedding) that autumn is coming to steal the show.
    Must-have Natural backdrops with mountains, lakes, falls, fields in any season rose the elopement wedding industry to new peaks.

    Entertainment is what I have been waiting for. And it came together with the chill atmosphere trading it for the traditional, classy and even stuffy at times.
    Now, fun and festive wedding celebrations are planned by my fellow wedding planners. And who’s not up for lawn games, giant Jenga, funny bridal quizzes,
    magicians, cringy skits, or petting llamas, donkeys and whatnot? Well .. I am game. And so was 2017.

    In regards to decor, metallic tones and dangling pieces are successfully incorporated into the bridal aesthetics. But I am especially grateful to
    <a href="https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year-2017" title="Introducing Greenery" target="_blank" rel="external">Pantone's colour of the year choice for 2017</a>.
    It made everything perfect. And I hope we will get to keep <a href="https://www.pinterest.dk/pin/341640321724131870/" title="Greenery wedding bouquets" target="_blank" rel="external">greenery</a> for a long while still.
</p>
<p>
    All throughout 2017 simple but romantic centrepieces, table runners or aisle decor took the place of intricate and time-consuming decorations.
    Leaves, branches, <a href="https://www.pinterest.dk/pin/492862752955024048/" title="Rustic moss decor ideas" target="_blank" rel="external">moss</a>,
    or pot plants were beautifully used for any wedding theme and through my Pinterest scrolling, I have seen that it matched any colour scheme.

    Even a new wedding style has emerged from all this green craze (which of course, I love) built on botanical or greenhouse motifs.

    Speaking of flowers, a change in the wedding bouquet has occurred, they became larger by playing with the sizes and widths of the flowers.
    Also, a more extensive variety of flowers is used now to make the bouquet. Bold colours and the messy look came to replace the neat and neutral of not long before.

    A new resource to bring creativity and authenticity to your big day is the wedding stationery. They are a lovely though sometimes costly way to emphasise
    your style or your couple’s dynamic- vintage patterns, bold watercolours, cartoon, etc.  So 2017 brought a lot of focus on paper goods, and the rise of calligraphy.
</p>
<p>
    Also, another way to bring up the couple’s ethos is the lounges, that became quite hip during last wedding season. For the couple and guests, comfy vintage couches,
    with luxurious rugs are just another way to be chill and chic.
