title: "To Have and To Hold: Wedding Trends 2019"
excerpt: "There is nothing more risky in a post than trying to predict trends,
but I will be bold and have a take at it for 2019 knowing that the worst outcome
will be a collection of beautiful unpopular trends."

It seems that for a few years now weddings are not only a love and butterflies
affair anymore but also a beautiful encounter with styling and design. And what
once were the goals for cinema stars and artists are now on the to-do list of
every bride. With every passing year, the wedding industry is getting more
beautiful, artsy and innovative. I am so happy to be able to witness all these
beautiful trends in the industry being unfolded. I will look at what to expect
in regards to trends and styling this year and present them to you.

## Macramé
Something which I really love and don’t mind seeing more of is the incorporation
of macramé or any needle and thread form of art in the wedding design.  It can
be used for aisle decoration, backdrops, hanging on what would be bland walls at
the reception venue. And any fabric work mixed with florals bring about the best
and most sought after bohemian vibes.

## Wedding Lounges
Wedding Lounges are the next big thing. We have been seeing them starting last
year more and more, but the experts say that this wedding season, lounge spaces
are a must. And why wouldn’t they be? Cozy and cool ways of chilling out with
your guests should have been a trend long ago. Morrocan decor is preferable for
these areas, such as low seating, carpets, cushions and a myriad of lights.

## Bold Colors
Following the Morrocan feel that became a wedding style in itself, is the use
of bold colors within any design element, flowers, table service, or linen. So
no more the somewhat bland hues of white, blush and ivory but lively tones of
maroon and rust.

## Lots of Flowers
Speaking of flowers, a significant role in wedding styling will be the floral
installations. The bigger, the better. Hanging on the walls, or above the dinner
tables, in the form of arbors, or as decoration for the ceremony set-up.
Floristry will have us in awe this upcoming season, and I can’t wait to see the
artists creativity.

## Bohemian Bridal Dresses
In regards to bridal attire, I love what I see: more boho dresses, with open
backs and oodles of gorgeous lace, the word used in the bridal wear of this year
is Modest and thank God because I wasn’t very thrilled with the ones of last
years: Nude and Tattoo dresses. We also have the gorgeous bridal hat that brings
a desert vibe, and I love that you can choose the type of embellishment, if you
opt for one: fresh or dried flowers, feathers, you name it.

## Colorful Suits
Another trend I absolutely agree with is color for the groom’s suit.
I have seen some flattering cinnamon or dark lilac fitted suits and ever since I
have my heart fixed on colorful apparel for the groom. It might not be for
everyone or for the classy and elegant type of wedding, but it is for my ever
favorite bohemian style.

Also as far as I have seen, "rust" will be the color most preferred in the
wedding industry despite Pantone’s color of the year "living coral". And guess
which one I like most?

## Mixed styles
Last year’s magic word was "personalization" throughout the entire wedding
planning process. Couples were advised to be as themselves as possible and to
come with all the personal decor elements or details to conjure up a fresh
wedding day. A trend I was very much on board with. This year I feel that the
all-encompassing word for the  wedding decor/design is "eclectic".

I think that this year will be an outstanding one in regards to bridal aesthetic
and I look forward to seeing it unfold and being shaped by awesome wedding
suppliers around the world.

Have a wonderful wedding season ahead, everyone!
