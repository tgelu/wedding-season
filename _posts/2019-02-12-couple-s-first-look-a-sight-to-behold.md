title: "Couple's First Look: A Sight to Behold"
excerpt: "From the many decisions a couple should face in planning their big
day, this one is one of the most exciting. Should you see each other in your
wedding attire on the aisle or should you plan a private shoot to capture the
\"first look\"?"

As everyone says, wedding days are a whirlwind of emotions. Every single moment
of what would otherwise be an ordinary thing, is imbued with lots of feelings
and a grappling sensation of making sure you are in the moment. That is usually
caught on camera because it never comes back. Simple things like having
breakfast or putting make-up on are becoming all of a sudden fastidious,
emotional. Therefore all day long you are a bucket of nerves, of feels, emotion
and excitement; at every corner, there will be a grandma or a guest crying,
someone showering you in compliments, a down the memory lane toast, an
overwhelmed dad. You should expect a full day of emotion, not too much privacy
or time for processing information. It does go by fast.

This is the reason we got "the first look". It is a new concept that goes
back only a few years because traditionally, the bride and groom would see
each other only at the altar, having not seen each other with a day before.
I am a huge fan of the concept and I would advice all the couples to
do that for the following reasons:

**1**. That whirlwind has to stop for a bit so you can fully take the day in. A
first look provides the couple with taking a break. This might be the only time
when you are alone during the entire day. (Together with the photographer of
course... Nothing goes undocumented)

**2**. It offers the couple the privacy in which to revel together in the magic
of the day and let loose - cry together, or give a shout of joy, do a little
dance, be themselves.

**3**. It makes for a memorable moment to see your future spouse in their
wedding attire for the first time. Unforgettable. I tend to think that it is far
more romantic to see it alone than at the same time with all the guests.

**4**. Did I mention that the shots taken during these first-look-moments are
the ones everyone cherishes? They show unveiled, raw emotion, unique to every
couple and they tickle everyone's romantic bone.

**5**. A first look can also calm the nerves and jitters that the bride might
have before walking the aisle with everyone looking at her and being acutely
aware that she walks the shortest walk towards her happiness. (this can be
daunting!)

I didn't get to enjoy all these perks that come with the first look for my
wedding, and it's a pity because I feel that at least it would have steadied my
walk...  But not to worry, I am on a quest for gathering reasons for why I should
have a wedding again. (Yes, with the same goofball as the first time)

Would you consider a first look or would you instead go with tradition and see
each other at the altar for the first time?

Until next time, when I will look at the wedding trends set for this year.
