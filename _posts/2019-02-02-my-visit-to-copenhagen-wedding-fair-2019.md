For the last three years, every January I got ready for the highlight of the
wedding industry in Denmark, namely the wedding fair organized by [Bryllup.dk](https://bryllup.dk/).

The first year I went as an employee of another wedding company from
Copenhagen, [the second year]({% post_url 2018-01-19-copenhagen-wedding-fair-2018-an-opinion %})
I went as a noob in the industry, having opened [my own company]({% post_url 2018-01-08-seasons-and-reasons %})
that autumn. In this third year I went casually, meeting fellow colleagues and
making new friends.

The first thing that I noticed was the crowd, a smaller number of attendees and
vendors. It seemed quieter than in the past. I found the same vendors positioned
almost in the same places as in the previous years and therefore it is possible
that because of this, the space seemed familiar and smaller. I certainly
hope that the Danish wedding world isn’t shrinking.

Another thing that I was aware of and maybe a bit saddened by was exactly what I
mentioned before: same vendors. While I loved saying hi to the ones I knew
already and applaud their achievements, I eagerly wanted to see new faces in the
industry, innovation and diversity, more options. Truth be told this has more to
do with the state of the wedding industry in Denmark rather than the fair
itself.

If you are a bit introduced to the wedding market in Denmark there is a third
thing that you can’t help but notice. The fair was mainly built around the
bigger names in the industry: mainly bridal houses and jewelry stores. Quite
literally too. The bigger the name, the bigger the booth, and that is
understandable from a marketing point of view but from a creative entrepreneur
vantage point, it is a bit underwhelming. There was no space for the little
companies, for the creative souls in the market. And I know they are out there,
in their little studios because I am admiringly following them from the comfort
of my Instagram profile. While I am happy to see their work online, I would have
loved to be able to interact with them as a fair allows one to do. I would have
appreciated seeing them represented.

Ohh and one more thing: where was the little chocolate that came in the goodie
bag at the entrance? That is usually something I am looking forward to when I am
back home, relaxing and browsing the magazine.

There were a few vendors that stood out this year. Both [Whispering
Vintage](https://www.whisperingvintage.com/) and [A Table
Story](https://atablestory.dk/) had just gorgeous displays of wedding creativity
and talent. You can see them highlighted in my [Vendor
Spotlight](/#vendor-spotlight) section on the frontpage.

I loved to see [Celina Christensen](http://celinachristensen.dk/) and touch
their laceworks. So gorgeous! I enjoyed their modern and bohemian vibes on the
catwalk, and I fell head over their heels. I always complain about the lack of
stylish wedding shoes, but that booth made my whiny heart sing.

One sweet addition to this year’s fair was [The Rolling
Joy](https://www.therollingjoy.com/). I went by their stand to say hi to the
girls in person, and it was such a pleasure to meet them.  They are
service-minded and really open and chatty. The photobooth they have installed in
the hippie van was, to say the least, whimsy and fun. Stay tuned. Some awesome
collaborations are in sight.

I am always in search of alternative wedding venues that show personality or
that are memorable through their frame. This year I found a quaint little place
at the fair, among all the fancy, 5-star hotels representing
[Hornbækhus](https://www.hornbaekhus.com/). I found the venue lovely and
absolutely hyggelig. It is a 36-rooms boutique hotel, with vintage, bohemian
details that made me so ready to go and visit.

I really appreciated the booklet from [Ink Saloon](https://www.inksaloon.com/)
together with the little calendar that they give away every year. It has useful
tips and tricks and just good information in regards to stationeries together
with some inspiration. I am quite sure all the overwhelmed newly engaged couples
were able to appreciate the booklet even more since, well... they need it.

Another wedding supplier that I had the pleasure of chatting and hopefully
working with later on was [Miss Liss
Blomster](https://www.instagram.com/flowersbymissliss/). I stopped because of
their super cute flower adorned bicycle. I felt that is the epitome of
Copenhagen and I had to stop and see who they are. I wanted to take a picture
with their sweet bohemian flower crowns, but there was a long queue, so I just
admired the craftsmanship of Miss Liss and went to find me some chocolate
bonbons on the way out.

I enjoyed the fair quite a bit as you can read but what I really enjoyed this
year was [this year's "Bruden" magazine](https://bryllup.dk/bryllupsmagasiner/)
from [Bryllup.dk](https://bryllup.dk).  It was a delight at every page, and I
knew it would be a good experience as soon as I saw “Boho Romance” on the cover.
Not only because I am slightly obsessed with everything Boho but because I was
sure that the magazine would represent the wedding trends of the season very
well.  It did not disappoint. Boho dresses from all my favorite bridal houses,
the amazing editorials created by talented Danish vendors, and of course the
sweet real weddings featured, made this edition my favorite so far.

So with all this said, "tak for sidst" and ‘till the next year!  Oh and to those
planning their wedding for this upcoming season: happy wedding planning, you’ve
got this!
