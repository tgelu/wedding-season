I have today for you, in the middle of this summer heat wave, the most refreshing colorful and delicious piece of inspiration for those that are still working on their autumn wedding details, but for everyone really. This styled shoot being so warm and welcoming you will not only be inspired in your event planning endeavors but in how to spend your nearing autumn and make the most out of it.

As we all know Autumn is the harvest season, the most bountiful one in terms of color, produce and tantalizing tastes. This shoot is exactly about that. It wraps you in all the cozy fall details we all know and love: apple pies, caramelized apples and not to mention the cute apple stationery made by Danielle from [DcoLovenotes](http://www.dcolovenotes.com/) who was so kind to send us this feature to swoon over. 

The color palette is a beautiful vibrant combination of reds and orange and it is found in the littlest elements of the decor as to make it cohesive. The plaid blankets and the vintage furniture are making this celebration homey and unpretentious, exactly how I like my weddings.

I hope you enjoy this inspiration shoot and that it enriches your Fall goals as it did to mine:
- Take photos surrounded by the fallen and colorful leaves.
- Try and make the caramelized apples and as many cookies and biscuits as possible
- Buy new and cozy blankets and pillows
- Buy a new lipstick 
- Stop and smell all this madness of flowers and all cinnamon sticks I encounter.
