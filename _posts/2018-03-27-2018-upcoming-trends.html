    From what I have seen so far, fortunately, we get to keep most of the trends reviewed in <a href="/blog/2017-wedding-trends-retrospective.html" title="2017 Wedding Trends Retrospective">my last post</a>, but this year <a href="https://whimsicalwonderlandweddings.com/cool-edinburgh-city-elopement.html" title="Edinburgh city elopement" target="_blank" rel="external">"personalisation"</a> is the word. So the couples took a step further and not only broke up with formal and customary, but they went full swing with couple portraying and representation.
</p>
<p>
    And I think <a href="https://junebugweddings.com/wedding-blog/joshua-tree-wedding-pipes-canyon-lodge-rich-desert-romance/" title="Joshua Tree Wedding" target="_blank" rel="external">this bride</a> puts it so clearly and I couldn't agree more with her:
</p>
<blockquote cite="https://junebugweddings.com/wedding-blog/joshua-tree-wedding-pipes-canyon-lodge-rich-desert-romance/">
    “If there were anything I could share with a newly engaged couple, it would be to completely ignore what is popular right now and make every decision based solely off of whether or not it is representative of the two of you and your story as a couple.”
</blockquote>
<p>
    So if there's an element in your wedding that doesn't sing your tune, just chuck it, 2018 wedding trends are inviting us to do so.
</p>
<p>
    And I think that this introspective side of the wedding planning is beyond exciting because it offers a full and enjoyable experience for both parties.
</p>
<p>
    As a guest, you experience the little and wonderful world of the couple for an entire day (instead of the frills and stiffness that we all are so familiar with), just follow them through their rabbit hole. Wink.

    And also  now, because the couples tend to be more inner focused than trying to please the outside, everyone from friends to families, they feel less pressured or overwhelmed with the planning of their beautiful day, so they get to enjoy it from the engagement day to the sparklers send off. Just the way it should be.

    Another thing to be expected for 2018 is smaller wedding bashes, more intimate and through and through heartfelt celebrations. The natural outcome of this change is a more significant budget to splurge on dazzling customised decor and fancy food, weekend-long getaways with your closest family and friends.

    I am particularly fond of the wedding venue makeover of 2018. Out with barn ... and in with the <a href="http://www.100layercake.com/real-weddings/romantic-industrial-fall-wedding-at-luce-loft-in-san-diego/" title="Industrial loft fall wedding" target="_blank" rel="external">industrial loft</a>, quirky restaurants and charming pubs, deserts and forests, you name it. And usually, <a href="https://whimsicalwonderlandweddings.com/urban-industrial-chic-warehouse-wedding.html" title="Chic warehouse wedding" target="_blank" rel="external">alternative venues</a> can effortlessly feel more personal, less formal but full of character.

    Besides the flower wall, or arches and other beautifully decorated photo backdrops, 2018 brings a new statement piece of decor, none but the balloon installation, just <a href="https://www.brides.com/gallery/trend-were-loving-balloon-decorations" title="Wedding balloon decorations" target="_blank" rel="external">check out</a> how <a href="https://www.brides.com/" title="Brides.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Brides</a> is bringing the ballon back. Quite unexpected and ... random. But they look pretty, don't they?

    2018's colour is <a href="https://www.pinterest.dk/pin/476818679290739684/" title="Ultra-violet wedding" target="_blank" rel="external">ultra-violet</a>, and I can't get on board with it just yet, but it's only March, so I have time to make my peace with it.

    2018 will favour some specific pieces of decor, such a the bohemian <i title="The art of knotting string in patterns to make decorative articles">macramé</i>, for table or walls, the <a href="http://www.bridesmagazine.co.uk/planning/receptions/reception-themes/2017/2018-wedding-trends/gallery#!photo8" title="Vintage vases" target="_blank" rel="external">vintage vases</a>, agate coasters for the names places and also <a href="https://www.theknot.com/content/12-places-to-use-wedding-wreaths" title="12 places to use wedding wreaths" target="_blank" rel="extneral">wedding <i title="An arrangement of flowers, leaves, or stems fastened in a ring and used for decoration">wreaths</i></a> will come into play, for any season.

    I will summarise 2018 as the collection of the recent years' trends but edgier and more customised.
    I am stoked about it. I am looking forward to interacting with all these trends and even come up with some of my own if I am not too audacious!?
