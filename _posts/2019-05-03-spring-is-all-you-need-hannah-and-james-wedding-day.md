title: "Spring is All You Need. Hannah and James' Wedding Day"
excerpt: "There is no doubt about the popularity of spring weddings, but who can
point to why is it so? Is it the flowers, the weather, the optimism of the
season? Enjoy a prime example of such a wedding and mahbe you'll be persuaded
it's the flowers... or the weather... or the optimism of the season."

As promised last time, I come today with a wonderful real wedding, adorned with
the sweetest Spring details. I do appreciate in season, personal and minimal
decor at a wedding with the accent put on family and sharing moments together.
And this wedding day has exactly that: on spot decor, genuine laughs, lots of
family and love.

I hope you will enjoy browsing through this day and you will be inspired by this
Spring-y vibe it puts out.

Thank you, [Hannah](https://hannahkphotography.co.uk/), and you, peeps stay in
touch because for the next post I have the most beautiful and artistic
style-shoot to share right from the middle of Copenhagen that you don't want to
miss out on.

## From the Photographer

Hannah and James chose to get married at their home church, St. Matthews in
Walsall on the 7th April 2018. The service was a beautiful act of thanks to God
through song, prayer over the bride and groom and of course James and Hannah‚Äôs
vows to honor, love and serve each other for the rest of their lives. All 200+
guests let out a huge cheer and applause when the now husband and wife sealed
the deal with a kiss!

Soon after the ceremony, guests arrived at Redhouse Barn in Worcestershire for
the wedding reception. The renovated barn was beautifully decorated in simple,
modern, light and airy details. I absolutely LOVE modern and minimal decor. I
had a field day capturing all the green and white table settings full of foliage
and gold detailing. Plus those clear wedding chairs, shiny dinnerware, and
Sauvignon Blanc... I just love wedding details!

Following the bride and groom and family photos, the father of the bride, the
groom and three best men gave heartwarming, emotional and hilarious speeches. I
wish I could write them all out for you because they were just so good!!

Finally, to finish off the night, Entertainment Nation‚Äôs Jam Hot kept the dance
floor packed, and the groom even made a debut on bass!

### The Inspiration for the Decor

Initially, we were aiming for the Saturday of Easter weekend, and we were going
with a spring,  Easter theme. Lots of greens and whites and golds. We had to
change the date for the week after due to venue availability, as it was after
Easter we wanted to step away from it being an ‚ÄúEaster‚Äù wedding but still keep
the beautifully crisp, clean, light and airy feel and mixed it with lots of deep
natural greens mixed in with elegant and slightly rustic golds.

### DIY Projects

Neither of us is overly blessed in the art department. However, we are blessed
with some incredible friends and family who helped us out with all their
different talents and gifts. It‚Äôs not what you know it‚Äôs who you know ;)
- I visited lots of antique shops and charity shops to get all the gold frames
  then my wonderful friend Lucy did the artwork for the cards and gifts table,
  for order of the day,  the bible verse and the Jenga guest book.  -my dad
  worked on how to stand frames on tables -a friend‚Äôs husband printed our table
  plan (we used an Etsy designer for our table plan and invites)
- James‚Äô amazing Auntie made our wedding cake
- We put our DIY skills into the menu. We are BIG foodies so putting together
  the menu, from canap√©s to drinks,  the antipasti and the shared starter to our
  epicurean of desserts to suit people‚Äôs tastes was one of our favorite part of
  the wedding planning process. We loved hearing people getting excited about
  what we had chosen and what they were going to pick to eat.

### Favorite Moments of the Day

For us, our wedding day was about the journey God has us on and the people in
our lives. We wanted our wedding day to honor both of these things. So many of
our friends made our wedding day beautiful and personal
- James‚Äô favorite moment of the day was seeing all our friends and family meet
  each other, having all our favorite people under one roof talking and having a
  wonderful time together. Seeing people enjoying food and drink, laughing and
  sharing life- we couldn‚Äôt resist joining them even if it meant leaving our
  table. We love our people.
- My most memorable part of the day was standing at the front of the church in
  worship, so so grateful and in awe of how God had orchestrated things that had
  led us to that exact moment of becoming husband and wife surrounded by people
  who have and continue to champion us, encourage us and support us. 
- And another favorite moment of mine (if I‚Äôm allowed to have more than one) was
  dancing in the evening. We were so blessed to have some of James‚Äô friends from
  Jam Hot play, and they really brought the party. The dance floor was packed
  from the first note to the last. So many people commented on how they‚Äôd never
  seen so many people on the dance floor for the entire night! It was just so
  much fun. James played the bass for a couple of songs which was heaps of fun,
  and I got promoted from non-musical fangirl to tambourine player üòÇ

### What Did and What Didn't Go as Planned

Amazingly most things went to plan. We prioritized what needed doing first and
slowly worked our way through the list of ‚ÄúTo-Dos.‚Äù Two major things that helped
was getting to know and trusting our vendors. They know what they‚Äôre doing so
sharing a bit of who you are with them and getting to know them too meant it was
easy to trust their suggestions for our day.  Another important thing was having
an excellent MC for the day, the venue arranged for him to be there and we
couldn‚Äôt be more grateful. He was super professional and allowed the day to move
along smoothly, everything ran on time, and it meant we were able to enjoy
everything without feeling stressed about how the day was going.  The only thing
that didn‚Äôt go to plan was the timing of getting ready in the morning for the
girls (we could have done with the MC there too üòÇ)! As we were all running a
little behind it meant my mum not being able to help me into my wedding dress
which was sad for us both.

My advice to future brides would be to allow much
more time than you think you need, something is always going to take a bit
longer, and it‚Äôs nice to have time to soak everything in.  Thankfully for me, I
had an amazing sister,  a best friend and a photographer (now friend) with me
and they helped me get ready and were there for me in those ‚Äúwaiting‚Äù moments-
that was unforgettable.  Oh, and the confetti pops... that definitely didn‚Äôt go
