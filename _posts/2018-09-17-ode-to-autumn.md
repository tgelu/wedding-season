September is one of my favorite months, not only because it gives the start to the coziest season- autumn, but also because this month three years ago I said <em>"Yes"</em> to the most amazing man and we lived happily ever after.

I love autumn for many reasons. One could be the clothing: fashionable ponchos, cute ankle boots, fancy british looking hats, to name just a few. And there are the colors: fresh and exuberant. These are making a total wonder of every walk I take. 

I am not a beach and sea kind of girl, so autumn activities are my cup of tea. Literally. I drink crazy amounts of tea every autumn, I bake lots of cookies, and I devour every historical period drama there is. 
Oh and the food! I love pies and stews and soups, and well ... any comfort food. And this is the season for it. Fresh produce for any taste, gorgeous looking too, what more to ask for?

And I must say that autumn weddings have a special place in my heart. I feel that they have a more intimate and family oriented atmosphere surrounding them. And they give a lot of space for creativity, and it seems like they have a bit of edge or fairytale inherently (of course depending on where you are going with the planning endeavors).

Due to the massive choice of colors, you can play with the tones and hues quite a lot, and due to the beautiful spectacle that nature is putting this season, your backdrop for the ceremony or the couple session can easily be procured. 

But oh I could go on and on about how wonderful autumn is so I think I would instead show you. 
I will pick some of my favorite photos from colleagues in the wedding industry that showe cased autumn in all its glory. 

Are you planning an autumn wedding? What's your color palette? Will it be a harvest theme wedding? What's the main element behind your wedding concept?

I have found this mesmerizing inspiration shoot on [Rock My Wedding](https://www.rockmywedding.co.uk/dark-opulence/), and my heart melted. Just check the amazing outfit and accessories.

Autumn is almost synonym with Burgundy and I don't doubt way. As a color, it is easily incorporated in decor for the florals, such a the bouquet or centerpieces. It can be used for the wedding stationery, announcing and setting the mood, or for the pop of color for the wedding cake. Burgundy gives edge and elegance in one dramatic swoop.

And here is how to use Pantone's color of the year, if you struggled with it as I did. I think this is one fancy autumnal cake.
