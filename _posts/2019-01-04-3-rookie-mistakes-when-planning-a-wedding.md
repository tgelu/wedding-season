Happy New Year, peeps! I hope you had a wonderful holiday season filled with
only the most magical moments! Ours, here in the Danish countryside was quiet
and *hyggelig*. We had friends over, played tons of games, and had the most
delicious roast duck.

Now, are you ready for the new year's challenges and adventures? Because I am
certainly not. I am just a bag of emotions at every beginning of the year: hope,
excitement, and anxiety cohabit very well for the first few months until I
adjust my vision and my goals. But I am eagerly waiting to see what 2019 unfolds
and if my plans and projects come through.
Last year was quite a fantastic year for me and its peak was reached in
November when I planned my first wedding editorial. As with everything new, I
was excited but a bit terrified as well. I have been planning this styled shoot
for the early autumn days all summer long, but for different reasons, it got
postponed, a thing that came with its own separate set of challenges.

One of the reasons for changing the date and of course the vision board I have
built many months in advance was that I couldn't find the conservatory I wanted
to create the entire shoot around. Copenhagen has quite a few gorgeous ones, but
they either weren't available by being fully booked because the wedding season
was still in full swing at that time - early September or the locations
weren't interested in joining a style-shoot. (I feel that the concept is not very
common or popular in Denmark). Another possibility is that these venues just
didn't want to work with a noob like me in the wedding industry, which is
totally understandable. Due to **either** of these, my September board
transformed in a November one and I couldn't be more happy with how things
unraveled; however, this brings me to my first mistake.

## Time management

Though I am a control freak, this seasonal change bloop overthrew my planning.
Though I have a to-do list for my official to-do list, and I plan everything,
and I use two different printed calendars and a digital one, my plans did not
hold. It left me with only a couple of months to organize it all and pitch the
vendors. Not only that the time-frame was now out of balance buuut I also
"succeeded" not to allocate enough time on the day itself for the vendors. So
everything ended up being squashed - setting up the tables, light try-outs, the
cake needed a bit of mending and so on.

This big mistake brought the following consequences:
- The stationery, which arrived from Spain, reached us 40 minutes
  **into** our style-shoot. (Lots of fretting had happened around my mailbox).
- We didn't have time for lunch, just some overly sugared snacks, which made us
  more tired and crankier.
- We didn't have many breaks either.
- We hurried up to make sure we shoot all the frames we wanted.
- And we had to compromise: some of my beloved details received less attention
  than others.

## Understimating the creative process

What I mean by this is simply that I didn't count in how versatile is a
tablescape or any wedding decor, and how many detailed shots you can get out of
it. I couldn't stop arranging and re-arranging for better shots, for different
angles. I fiddled with the stationery and the tableware much more than my "Plan
of the day" allowed me to. But that is because styled shoots are a creative
process and no matter how you put it down on paper or how well you plan it
before, there should be time and space to create and brainstorm **during** the
shoot, for better results and more fun too.

## Not pitching in due time to enough vendors

Pitch the shoot to more creatives. I had a list with the vendors I wanted to
work with, and I only invited those, out of which most declined being either
very busy or not interested in the concept which left me with **barely** the
minimum of wedding suppliers needed to plan a wedding editorial.

The consequences that followed this mistake were:
- Adding more stress leading up to the day than necessary because almost until
  the due day I wasn't sure who is in or not. Lots, lots of stress.
- Everything ended up being a DIY kind of affair. I actually enjoyed doing most
  of the things by myself, but I think that the creativity of more vendors on
  the spot would have made the shoot even more extraordinary than it already is.
  So the lesson here is plain: better to have two wedding cakes to shoot than
  none.

There have been more mistakes than these of course, but I feel that if I hadn't
had these to deal with, the others would have been of little consequence. And
still with them all, I am so happy I had the opportunity to work on a wedding
inspiration shoot with such lovely people that I look forward to presenting to
you once the editorial is published (fingers crossed!). I am pretty sure that
when you see the amazing photos, you won't notice my mistakes but you will be
able to appreciate our creativity and love for the concept we came up with for
this late autumn editorial.

For next time I have yet another real wedding to share with you, to inspire you
with and spread the love.
Have a fabulous first weekend of the year!
