Traditionally they have been around for quite a while. But the elopements, or the runaways to the courthouse and get hitched without fuss and usually in secret are a thing of the past. Just as the notorious Vegas weddings are, thank heavens, these were beautifully replaced by the stylish and glamorous affair of traveling to exotic or secluded places with your future spouse, an adventurous wedding photographer and maybe a few of your closest kin. 

The rise of the elopement trend has to do with the break of norms that the wedding industry is so familiar with by now. No more cookie-cutter kind of weddings, formal, stiff, expensive and paid by the parents. On the contrary, the couples tend to opt-out and follow their hearts, and consequently, this leads to gorgeous, lush landscapes, mountain peaks, blue water secluded lakes, known woods or fields among the elopements experts. I.e., none others than passionate travelers, avid nature lovers, specialized photographers.

And don't think that it HAS to be bare decor or minimal. Yes, the whole point as I see it is to let nature shine and bring your love and the relationship as the main character of the story. And it can be just that. 
But you can also upgrade and bring in some elements, such as a flower arch maybe, or a picnic like sweetheart table filled with your favorite snacks, platter or the like. You can't be posh, 3-course meal up the hill after you hiked 4 hours.

Not only that is uber cool now to elope, a great alternative to the celebrate your nuptials but I also think that elopements are so romantic and emotional. You get to soak in the day instead of the"hug and greet" routine and to be yourself, no frills or trying to please anyone.

I hope I made a case for this wedding style, but if you still have doubts, the following is an elopement inspiration sent to me by Andreas from [Blitzkneisser](https://www.hochzeitsfotograf.tirol/) and I am pretty sure that this gorgeous session will at least make you consider an outdoor ceremony with a natural backdrop. I totally fell for it. 

A little behind the scene of this gorgeous elopement inspiration: the shoot took place at [Blaser](https://goo.gl/maps/A1jrbzpqEEm), at over 2200 meters. The arch is built by Andreas himself (the talented photographer behind Blitzkneisser) with his father, and it is decorated by [Frau Baumann](http://www.fraubaumann.at/).

Enjoy and let me know where you are at on this elopement thing. I almost did it three years ago when [I got married]({% link _posts/2017-12-31-here-comes-the-bride.html %}). Maybe I will do it for our coming five year anniversary?
