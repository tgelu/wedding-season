In these last days of Spring I have enjoyed the most artistic treat in the shape
of the style-shoot planned by Caytlin from [Aeipathy
Studio](https://www.aeipathystudio.dk/). She and her team of brilliantly
creative vendors put together a sight to behold. The shoot is based on the
praised terracotta color and the rugged, arid yet tranquil nature surrounding
Copenhagen. The accent is on the ceramic pieces that [Robynn
Storgaard](https://instagram.com/robynn.storgaard) is creating and I hope you will delight in the
unfinished look of her creative universe alongside the bohemian vibes Caitlyn
has imagined for the dusk of a warm day in Copenhagen.

I think that Denmark has only a few wedding creatives, but all of them are
beaming with creativity and love for their craft. The Scandinavian design
inspires them, and that makes their work authentic and highly appreciated. The
bohemian mood, the earthy colors, the minimal but rich in aesthetics type of
decor are just some of the elements we are after here in this tiny Scandinavian
country. And I think this is precisely what you will see looking through Mia’s
(the storyteller) eyes at this gorgeous inspiration shoot:

<blockquote>
“As the slow embrace of golden hour spreads across the rippling field, we begin
to make ourselves at home under the branches of the silver birch. A delicate
piece of hanging linen adds a soft touch of alabaster white, while the warm heat
of the afternoon fades and we gather for shared stories and sustenance,
rejoicing in good food and good company. The tree beckons to those who haven’t
yet arrived, its silver bark effervescent in the tall prairie grass. Warmth
fills the evening even as the last rays of the sun depart, the subtle texture of
the handcrafted ceramics complimenting the flowers that fill our evening with
fragrance. As we come together, wanderers in our own right, we fall into an easy
conversation, sharing the secrets of our respective crafts. ”
</blockquote>

Enjoy and do send some love to this amazing team.
