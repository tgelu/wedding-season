Hello peeps, I hope you have been enjoying the coming of Spring. I surely did:
having my coffee on the terrace in the breezy sunny mornings, walking in the
blooming forest near my house, taking in all the colors, smells and sounds and
seeing the first flowers blossom in my garden - this season definitively warmed
my heart.

I have been out and about this last month, but I am happy to come back with
somewhat of a treat: I can finally show you the stunning results of our moody
November style shoot. I know it’s a season too late but inspiration shouldn’t
have a time limit. It should only delight our eyes and ignite our creative
bones, I hope this style shoot will do just that. :)

I must say that this was a great experience from which we all have learned a
lot. We made new friends and we had lots of fun. Before the day of the style
shoot, bouncing off ideas in a creative atmosphere, and on the day itself,
busying around, setting up everything. Also, the fact that we got to eat the
wedding cake my friend made for the shoot, made the end of the shoot day so much
sweeter. Yummy.

Traditionally November is a dreadful month in Denmark, it is usually a bit
gloomy, bare, wet and overcast through and through and therefore quite avoided
and overlooked in the wedding industry. But this was actually the mood that
inspired this editorial shoot.

## The season

I always thought that all seasons have something beautiful to gift the bride and
groom: spring has rejuvenation of nature and spirit, big blooms, intense colors.
Summer- the favored by all, has the golden hour, sunlight until the breeze of
evening,  gorgeous fields of wildflowers. Fall gives us the quickening of the
heart due to its colorful and seemingly moving nature, and of course, we come to
winter that gives snow-covered grounds, holiday season cheer, pine cones, and
wreaths, but what has November to offer? Which is not really part of the fall
season nor the winter one.

November feels like a lone and gloom standing by itself month.  But in my view,
November has stillness. Quiet and intimate wedding celebrations, dim light
dinners, intense emotions, and raw resources and decor.

Also traditionally in Denmark weddings are held either at a castle or a barn.
The country is blessed with quite a few of each.  But with this shoot, I tried
to break a bit the custom and looked for a different kind of venue. And I think
that with its help, the main characteristics of this shoot: a **November
mood**in an **urban setting**, are visibly emphasized.  Also, the details such
as the tablescapes, the flowers, the chosen color palette, and the stationery
are meant to underline these two design concepts.

## The flowers

The organic flowers in dark tones with sprinkles of auburn made into beautiful
untamed arrangements accompanied by twigs, reeds and vines and anything the
forest behind the venue offered together with more popular choices like roses
and King Protea were to bring the **rawness** of the season and the outside
natural November habitat inside.

## The Tablescapes

The tableware in grey and charcoal with its unfinished look is meant to
highlight the industrial and urban feel we wanted alongside the above mentioned
natural November rawness. But in order to soften the tablescape and to bring
about a feeling of wedding celebration, I opted for Rosa, romantically
embellished glasses, and handwritten paper suite.

## The Venue

Our venue, which is a recently opened restaurant in my own Stars Hollow town of
some sort, so easily provided us with the look we wanted. A bit urban owing to
its New York gliding doors and cafe street lights. A bit rustic due to its
wooden frames and a whole lot of moody all set in black, dark blue and grey
tones.

## The Bride

For the model, we chose a very simple wedding dress that we later on matched
with a woolie and a blanket considering the chilly Danish weather.  We chose
some dark make-up shades for the bride in contrast with the sweet updo to follow
the pattern chosen: moody combined with romantic elements.

## The Stationery

The stationery was designed as a dash of elegance and a feminine touch to soften
the overarching edge.  It was handwritten on beautiful hand-made paper with blue
ink for the menus and invitations while the seating places are in gold. The
envelope together with the wax seal is in the blue color palette of the design.

We hope to inspire some daring couples to choose a moody November day for their
wedding celebration with this shoot, or at least to bring attention to the
beautiful elements that November has to bring.
