As promised, this week I am sharing with you yet another lovely wedding.
Personal and laid back, as you probably know by now, is my favorite kind of
ceremnoy. This sweet family bash is beautifully captured by
[Hannah K Photography](https://hannahkphotography.co.uk/), and I am so delighted
that you will get to be inspired by this bubbly bride and groom's wonderful
wedding day.

For me, this wedding feature was a fresh breath of air not only because of the
spring colors and flowers and the sunshine, that we all desperately need in
these days of winter, with no snow but lots of wet and grey. But I loved the
personal details the couple chose for their day such as "Be thou my vision" as
the first hymn of their so heartfelt wedding ceremony. The poem the bride wrote,
the family prayer and the cute little pink bridesmaids' dresses were some of the
so many other details that I am inviting you to read and see for yourself. Enjoy
and be inspired!

## From Hannah, the photographer

<blockquote>
"Hannah and David are hands down one of the sweetest, generous and
most down to earth people I have ever had the privilege of meeting. From the
very beginning when our conversations were contained in an email inbox, to their
engagement shoot at Westonbirt Arboretum in Gloucestershire, all the way through
to their wedding day at The Barn at Upcote in Cheltenham on the 14th April 2018,
they have been considerate and gracious through and through.

I don’t think Hannah could have been a more relaxed bride the morning of her
wedding even if she tried! Her character is full of peace and grace, and it just
overflows into whatever room she’s in. With the cutest matching kimonos and
bubbly, Hannah and her five bridesmaids had their hair and makeup done by Bella
Bridal Hair at Hannah’s parent’s house… in plenty of time to arrive at the bride
and groom’s home church, Trinity Church, for the wedding ceremony.

As believers, Hannah and David made sure their wedding ceremony was full of
praise and thanks to God. Their love for God was indeed made evident in the
songs they sang, the scripture readings and the friends and family they asked to
pray over their married life together. And what better way to celebrate their
marriage than by showering them with bucket-fulls of dried flower petal confetti
and joining them at The Barn At Upcote for Prosecco, canapés and lawn games.
After a three-course meal catered by Mcbaile Catering, there were heartfelt
speeches (Hannah even surprised David and their guests with the sweetest poem!)
and to top it all off, the biggest barn ceilidh I’ve ever seen!"

## From Hannah, the bride

<blockquote>
"The theme - was never officially defined but David and I both
liked the rustic, barn-feel but trying to keep it elegant. A lot of time was
spent browsing Pinterest. We aimed to provide a relaxed and not too showy
environment, in keeping with our personalities.

There were quite a few DIY projects to try to keep costs down and fortunately we
had a willing family team on both sides to help out. Our wedding was also very
well timed to coincide with my sister being free and available on her university
holidays.

David's mum and her crafty friends were responsible for decorating a lot of the
jam jars. The flowers on the tables were a team effort of the whole family,
throwing together a collection of flowers brought from the Cheltenham flower
market and greenery from my Grandparents garden. This was a worry before the
day, but it is amazing how flowers can look pretty when thrown together. My
parents and sister did a fantastic job in making the welcome sign, seating plan,
and the photo board. David designed all of the invites, orders of service and
menus for the tables and David's mum very kindly tied all the orders of service
together with ribbon. We borrowed the bunting at the church from one of my
friends who had made it for her wedding."

<blockquote>
"It is very difficult to pick a favorite moment of the day because we loved all
of it. David's favorite moment was when I stood up to say a poem I'd written
during the speeches because it was a complete surprise for him. And I think my
favorite moment was when we stood holding hands at the front of the church with
our Dads on either side and the band started singing 'Be Thou My Vision,' our
first hymn. It just felt so right and that God was there. I did also love the
ceilidh, and it was a great way of seeing people.

We learned in the wedding planning process that David loves being organized and
making lists. Therefore, there weren't many unwelcome surprises on the day that
hadn't been planned. There had also been a lot of prayer before the wedding.

Slight mishaps were forgetting the ivy for the church's sign when decorating it
the night before; however, my mum was sent around to my house to cut the
eucalyptus of the neighbor's tree. Also, the incorrect postcode on the
directions to the reception venue, so a few guests were taking longer than
expected to get there. We also managed to put David's wedding ring onto his
right hand instead of his left, but this moment is now one of our favorite
photographs.

Regarding what went right, we somehow managed to choose the first sunny day of
the summer. It was 9 degrees, wet and windy two days previously when we dropped
off stuff at the reception venue. However, our wedding day was glorious
sunshine, and David had to steal suncream off my one-year-old niece to protect
his head.

Other amazing things were our wonderful friends who formed the worship band, and
they really helped set the tone of the wedding as being a celebration to God.
They also proved a good talking point for non-church friends at the wedding who
were used to primary school hymns."

I hope you got all fuzzy inside and you have pinned some of these chic rustic
details for your big day. I wish you a wonderful weekend!

Next time I will come and share about the biggest wedding fair in Denmark that
takes place every year in January. So stay tuned for some reviewing and vendor
recommendations.
