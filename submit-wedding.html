<p>We are always on the look for real weddings and any kind of creative content to featured on our blog.</p>

<p>If you believe your submission falls into one or more of the following styles, you are for sure a good fit: <em>bohemian, rustic, indie, intimate, backyard, glam, woodsy, boho-chic, whimsical</em>.</p>

<h2>For vendors</h2>
<p>Your work can never have too much exposure online. Be it photos, videos, decorations, table arrangements or any kind of wedding related service, it will only help your business, big or small, to have others enjoy it and share it around.</p>
<p><em>We promise</em> to always give credit where it is due with proper appreciation for the work and links to the vendors.</p>

<h2>For couples</h2>
<p>We invite you to showcase your wedding day for the world to see. <em>We promise</em> to do our best in writing about it based on your description, and to find a beautiful way to tell the day's story through the media you upload.</p>
<p>Look at it as an opportunity to share the beauty of your big day with the world. The link to the wedding feature we will write is <em>the simple</em> way to preserve and show friends the highlights of the wedding day.</p>

    <div class="input-description">
        Any link that points to the relevant media is fine (dropbox, google drive, onedrive, iCloud, box.com, weShare, blog post etc.).
        <br/><br/>For the size of the photos, we expect at least a width of 720px to ensure quality content.
        We hope you can share at least 50 photos that help tell the story of the day, so that we can properly feature the event.
        <br/><br/>Keep in mind that detailed shots, portraits, venue and decor shots work best.
